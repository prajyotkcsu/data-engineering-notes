## Why sharding is a bad idea?

1. Sharding is logical splitting of a database to make reads and writes efficient. By having 3 shards/subset of data reads and writes becomes simpler because there is lesser data to deal with. But the problem with dividing databases are as follows,
a. deciding which data goes into which shard
b. in case of data bulging in one shard do we further shard the shard.
c. if b arise, routing logic needs to be changed as well.
d. lastly for data analysis, data from all shards need to be merged together which requires engineering.
e. although things like routing logic, join logic can be done using third-party tools but they come with their set of problems.

Therefore, sharding is difficult and an ever evolving problem. No engineering effort is enough to manage sharding entirely.
